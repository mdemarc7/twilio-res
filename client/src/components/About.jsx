                I believe in Twilio as a company and the democratization of communication channels.
                </li>
                <li>
                Twilio's vastness of products and their endless uses is impressive and it's something I want to be apart of.
                </li>
                <li>
                I'm intrigued and amazed to see Twilio's prevelance in several popular applications, yet still many unknowingly take advantage of Twilioâ€™s vast options of products.
                </li>
                <li>
                I share professional values with Twilio, notably "No shenanigans", "Draw the owl", and "Empower others".
                </li>
